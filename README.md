# Theo's Sandbox
This hobby project was started in October 2025 and my goal is to challenge myself to do more frontend, and especially to explore and solidify my CSS skills.

This is an SPA where my goal is to load and unload modules as the user navigates using a navbar, with my aim to have a responsive design that works down to a 320px screen width.\
The project to start will use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the use of Bootstrap and a choice of framework being something for each individual module that will be added.

My goal is to use this as a sandbox to create whatever type of module I think would be fun, interesting, or challenging to make (hopefully each new mini project will be all three).\
I intend to start with modules that run client side only but my plan is to find free APIs I find interesting and create modules with them.

## Current features
### Navbar
The navbar has two positions based on screen width. Regardless of position it has a carousel to navigate between modules via their icons (_placeholders for now_), and an expandable area which displays module names (_placeholders for now_)

All assets in the navbar are and will continue to be made by myself, with no use of Bootstrap or other catalogues other than for inspiration
