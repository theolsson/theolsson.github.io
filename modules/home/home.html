    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      During the pandemic I needed something to occupy my time, so I decided to
      take a programming course. This was suggested to me by a colleague who had
      seen my usage of Excel to make intricate conditional calculators to help
      me automate my work and guard against errors. I discovered I found
      programming was not only enjoyable, but it also felt intuitive to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following semester I crunched a math course to be eligable for
      Vocational university - in Sweden called Yrkeshögskola. I was accepted and
      spent 2 years studying to become a web developer.

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
      While I am actively seeking a role in frontend, backend, or full-stack
      development, I am also preparing for a software engineering or computer
      science application to university in fall 2026 as a backup should I not
      find employment before then.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This project is meant to showcase smaller frontend projects like a
      portfolio. It's a project I can work on in my free time to inventory my
      current skills, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later
      transitioning to frameworks.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create an SPA hosted on GitHub pages which dynamically loads components
        and modules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have a responsive design that works down to a screen width of 320
        pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build a custom navbar from scratch responsible for navigation between
        modules.
      </li>
      <li>Solidify my current skills.</li>
      <li>Learn new skills.</li>
      <li>Have fun!</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Current Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Navbar</h3>
        <p>
          The navbar has two positions based on screen width. Regardless of
          position it has a carousel to navigate between modules via their icons
          - <span style="font-style: italic">placeholders for now</span> -, and
          an expandable area which displays module names -
          <span style="font-style: italic">placeholders for now</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          All assets, including the navbar design and interactions, are being
          created from scratch by my, without the use of frameworks like
          Bootstrap, relying instead on my own CSS and JavaScript skills
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Minigames</h3>
        <p>
          I intend to make a series of retro type minigames as their own
          modules. For example I have the intention of creating a button
          clicker, tic tac toe, snake, and pong.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Integration with APIs</h3>
        <p>
          I have a collection of APIs which I intend to use to populate data in
          certain modules - my first goal is to make a team builder using
          PokeAPI
